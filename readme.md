# Handmade Z Transition Effect

Hello Casey (and everyone),

I've knocked up a quick interactive thingie to demonstrate my proposal for a
visual effect for presenting/hiding z-layers as the Hero moves in Z:

https://lakmeer.github.io/handmade-z-transition-effect/

I like this effect because:

- fast enough to not be distracting
- not canned, the effect maps directly the player Z position
- reinforces the metaphorical visual 'stacking' of the layers
- will look really cool on stairs

If anyone has different ideas, please clone the github for this thing and tweak
it to make cool stuff! I'm all about everyone making more cool stuff.

Sorry if the code is madness, it's just a sketch I made this afternoon.
